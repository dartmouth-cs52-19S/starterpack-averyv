The environment that I set up contains powerful tools that reduce the complexity of developing a node js project by serving as a bundler, transpiler, linter, and more.  It relies on webpack, a module bundler that deliberately packages together all your dependencies, selecting only the things you need.  To set up this environment, I incorporated a variety of webpack loaders as development only dependencies.  The first, babel, is a transpiler that converts es6+ javascript syntax to es5 syntax, so that I can code es6+ based javascript files without worrying about potential compatibility issues.  The next, ESLint, is a linter that will examine my code for syntax and stylistic errors, to ensure that it adheres to a specific set of rules.  The list of dependencies also includes css and sass loaders, which allows me to use @import and url() in css, as well as to load SASS/SCSS files that will compile to CSS.  Again, this environment supports various tools that facilitate the process of developing a site or application.
